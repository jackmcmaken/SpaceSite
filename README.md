# SpaceSite
Webpage that fetches from 6 different APIs to display updated information about space, which includes daily space facts, current pictures of Earth, Mars rover photos, and more. This is a small personal project to practice interacting with different API endpoints, learn about the anatomy of HTTP requests, and further understand how clients and servers communicate across a network.
